# Battery
A Go library that gives you battery information, assuming one is present. 

# Platform Support
Currently, this library only supports OpenBSD.

# Rationale
I built this because I got tired of doing the math when running the `apm` command in OpenBSD (it returns minutes). This way, I would always be able to see the estimated battery life in a more human friendly way.
